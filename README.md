**Introduction**

Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, involves determining the emotional tone of a piece of text. In this project, we perform sentiment analysis on a dataset of movie reviews to classify them as either positive or negative.
The IMDB dataset consists of 50,000 movie reviews, which are evenly split between positive and negative reviews. The main goal is to preprocess the data, train a machine learning model, and evaluate its performance. The project achieved an accuracy of 89% on the test set, indicating a successful application of sentiment analysis to movie reviews.
